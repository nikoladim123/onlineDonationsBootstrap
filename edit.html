          <p class="ourGoal">Our goal every year is to run a first class softball program.
             To do that, we need your help. Our organization is solely responsible for raising all the funds needed to support the program and we want to make our players' season a truly memorable one. This fundraiser will help us to offset the cost of our upcoming season as well as pay for new uniforms and tournament expenses for the team. We want to give our student athletes the best opportunity to succeed and create as many new    memories as possible. The La Habra All Stars 10U Softball team is asking for your assistance to help make this possible.
             Any donation is greatly appreciated and a receipt will be issued for your support.</p>

          <strong class="strongOne">A Message from Head Coach Liz Peters...</strong>

          <p class="headCoach">As Head Coach of the La Habra All Stars 10U Silver program, I am very excited about the upcoming season. The mission of the All Stars 10U team is to give our players the opportunity to enhance their softball skills and their character development. We want players who have the skill, humility and character to succeed. </p>
          <p class="headCoach">As many of you know, to play, compete and win at this level of softball is really a year round commitment. My staff and I are hard at work each day planning, training and preparing our student athletes for the rigors both on and off the field. Along with the players commitment on the field, our parents dedication to our team is the key to our success. To help ease some of the financial burden on our parents and coaches, we are respectfully reaching out to our close friends, family and relatives for their support. Rest assured, every dollar we raise will directly benefit our team, which will include new uniforms, planned tournament expenses, and other misc. expenses that we will certainly encounter. </p>
          <p class="headCoach">On behalf of all our coaches and staff, I would like to personally thank everyone for their continued support. We will reach out to everyone as the season progresses to update you on our successes</p>
          <p class="headCoach">2016 is guaranteed to be an exciting season as we continue building a Standard of Excellence.</p>
          <p class="headCoach">Thank you for supporting La Habra All Stars 10U Silver Softball team!</p>
